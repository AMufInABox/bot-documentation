  Did you receive DMs from Invite Tracker or were you added to servers without
  your knowing?

# Why is Invite Tracker inviting me to servers?

Invite Tracker **does not** add you to servers **nor** does it randomly DM you messages.

You are receiving a "Join DM" because the server your account joined setup the bot to send the message.

If you did not join the server, you need to secure your account. Go to your **User Settings** -> **Authorized Apps**. You will want to look for any applications that contain "Join servers for you" and **Deauthorize** them.
