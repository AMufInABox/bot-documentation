# 📝 Command Management

## Command Channel Blacklist

This switch decides the effect of the [_<mark style="color:purple;">command channels</mark>_](command-management.md#command-channels) feature.

#### Blacklist (enabled)

The channels assigned as _command channels_ will be blacklisted.

Blacklisted _command channels_ are channels in which commands will not work.

#### Whitelist (disabled)

The channels assigned as _command channels_ will be whitelisted.

Whitelisted _command channels_ are the only channels where commands will work.

## Command Channels

This is where you assign channels to be either blacklisted or whitelisted.

If you only want commands to be used in a channel designated for bots only, an idea would be to whitelist that channel.

## Disabled Commands

This is where you disable specific commands for your server. Disabled commands may not be used by anyone.
