# âš™ Administration

## Prefix

This is where you assign Invite Tracker's prefix. A prefix is a symbol or word which you would put in front of a command. All commands require a prefix in front for them to work. Using the prefix in front of a command lets Invite Tracker know that you are speaking to it and that you want it to respond.

Please read the [<mark style="color:purple;">FAQ</mark>](../../faq.md#what-is-the-default-prefix-for-invite-tracker) for important information regarding the prefix.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">The default prefix of Invite Tracker is</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">`-`</mark><mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:green;">Keeping the prefix as simple as possible is the best option as it will not make commands hard to use.</mark>

<mark style="color:green;">Try to keep the prefix different from other bots so they do not respond when you are trying to use Invite Tracker's commands.</mark>

## Auto Roles

Automatic roles are automatically assigned to every new member.

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">Free servers can only have a maximum of 3 auto roles.</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">Premium servers can have an unlimited amount of auto roles.</mark>
{% endhint %}

## Management Roles

Users with at least one of the management roles are allowed to use all commands under the  [_<mark style="color:purple;">Management</mark>_](../../commands/management.md) command category.

{% hint style="success" %}
<mark style="color:green;">A good idea could be to assign the server's moderator role as a management role because a moderator's main purpose is to manage and moderate users.</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:orange;">Free servers can only have a maximum of 2 management roles.</mark>

<mark style="color:orange;">Premium servers can have an unlimited amount of management roles.</mark>
